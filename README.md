Reinforcement learning demo made with [Unity Machine Learning Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).  
The ants want to explore the terrain but also need to find power-ups and recharge. They leave trails proportional to their energy level. Each ant scans its vicinity for trails to follow. Pathways between power-ups emerge over time.

The project utilizes the now [outdated version 0.6 of ml-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/releases/tag/0.6.0a).
In order to run the trained models, you need to install the Unity TensorFlowSharp Plugin and add ENABLE_TENSORFLOW to Edit > Project Settings > Player > Configuration > Scripting Define Symbols in the Unity Editor.
An archived copy of the plugin is available [here](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0hz4Gx3Knz6D6iuU8fqcasIaw#TFSharpPlugin).
